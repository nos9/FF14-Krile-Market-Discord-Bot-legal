# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-17

## 1. Data We Process
To operate Discord interactions (such as slash commands and button components), the Bot may temporarily process Discord-provided identifiers, including:
- Discord user IDs
- Discord server (guild) IDs
- Discord channel IDs
- Command interaction metadata (e.g., timestamps and command options)

The Bot does **not** store message content. Any content is processed only to execute the requested command and is not retained.

## 2. How We Use Data
The Bot uses the data described above solely to:
- Respond to commands and provide requested features
- Restrict interactive components (e.g., search buttons) to the user who initiated them
- Maintain reliability and performance (e.g., short-lived caching and rate-limit protection)

The Bot does not generate revenue and does not monetize user data.

## 3. Storage and Retention
The Bot may store limited data in the following ways:
- **Temporary in-memory session data** (e.g., the initiating user’s Discord user ID) for interactive features such as item search.  
  This data is retained only for a short period (typically a few minutes) and then automatically deleted.
- **Short-lived cache data** to reduce external API usage and improve performance.  
  This cache does not include message content and is automatically deleted after a short period.

The Bot does not maintain a persistent database of user IDs, and does not intentionally log user IDs for tracking purposes.

## 4. Data Sharing
The Bot does not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.

## 5. User Rights
Users may request information about any stored data and request deletion by contacting the developer via Discord.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.

## 7. Contact
For questions or data removal requests, please contact the developer via Discord.
